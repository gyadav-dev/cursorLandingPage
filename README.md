# Deployed Link

https://gyadav-dev.github.io/cursorLandingPage/

## This contains the details of the sections recreated by me

### Top Navigation Bar

- I have put this section in the `header` semantic tag
- I have used a wrapper div inside it and given it width of 96% because visually cursor website also uses this margin throughout the website
- Inside this there are three wrappers to wrap three broad elements as appearing on the cursor website, namely logo, navigation and Call to Action
- I have used the white color for the text in this section
- One call to action button is given a little bit different styling

### Hero Section

- This section is inside the sematic `main` tag
- Easy to make section because there is just some text and a CTA button in one div and an image in the next div
- I used flex to create the layout
- Used flex-direction column to render the divs in column

### Trusted By Section

- Easy to make section using flex
- Two items were rendered using flex
- The first one was just text and was visually at the center of the page
- The next was the cards. It took some time to find the logos but in the end it easy to place them in flex

### Feature Section

- Each Feature Section consists of two columns, and this layout was created using flexbox
- The text column contains some text and call to action
- I have a special color `#f54e00` to visually distinguish the call to action link
- There are three features available

### Testimonials Section

- I have used flexbox and grid both in this section
- First the two major wrapper divs for text and cards were placed in the layout using flexbox
- Then the individual cards were arranged in the layout using grid
- This gave me confidence to work with grid

### Use cases Section

- I have again used grid in this section to place the usecases in three columns of equal width using `fr`
- Flexbox was then used in each card to display the text and the image

### Changelog Section

- Very easy to design section using the flex and grid
- First two wrapper divs were placed in the layout using flexbox
- Then the changelog cards were placed in four equal width columns using grid

### Team Section

- Used grid to display two columns of unequal width
- Then used flexbox in each column to display the date and text in column

### Final CTA Section

- Very Easy Section to make
- Used flexbox to display two wrapper divs in column and at the center of the page

### Footer Section

- Put in the footer semantic tag
- Five columns were put in the layout using flexbox

## Conclusion

Overall I have used flexbox and grid heavily to make this website landing page. The webpage I have designed looks like the original website.
